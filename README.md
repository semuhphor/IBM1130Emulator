IBM1130Emulator
===============

## IBM 1130 Emulator in C#

This is the IBM1130 emulator modified build and run in ,net core with runs on
Linux, Mac and Windows. To get started with .net core, see these links:

[Unit testing with .net core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test)

As of this writing the CPU seems to run just fine, and the 2501 card reader works in tests. I have started implementation
of the 2310 disk, but have a way to go.

I have left the powershell script in the project, but I have not tried to get it to work.

If you want to implement some of this, please submit a pull request. Please test drive any code that you write.

Thanks,
Bob Flanders
